However, it's essential to note that this prediction has limitations. It assumes a linear trend in the data, which may not capture the complex and potentially nonlinear patterns of ice formation and thawing in the lake. Additionally, external factors, such as climate change, could influence trends in Lake Mendota's ice cover. Therefore, while x* provides an estimate, it should be interpreted with caution and considered as a simplified projection."
